# Notebook for classification of tumor images

### I used an open database from kaggle :
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection

### This was implemented aimed at training a CNN to classify the images in two different classes, with the following labels {'no':0,'yes':1}.

### I used tensorflow, keras, numpy, cv2 and scikitlearn in a google colab environment.
